Deploys your global ruleset to `~/.cline/rules/`, Cline's native global rules directory,
so your rules are available in every project without per-project setup.

## Why

Cline loads rules from `~/.cline/rules/` automatically in every session — no symlinks,
no per-project configuration. Keeping `src/rules/` as the committed source of truth
means you can edit rules, commit them, and deploy to a new machine with a single command.

`deploy.zsh` also regenerates `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with `@-import` lines pointing at
the same `~/.cline/rules/` files, so Claude Code loads identical rules from the same
copy. One rule file, two clients.

## Using Claude Code and Cline together

If you alternate between Claude Code and Cline — for example, switching to Cline when
Claude token limits are reached — you only want to maintain one copy of your rules.

This plugin achieves that with a single-source strategy:

```
src/rules/clinerules-global.md   ← committed source of truth
          │
          └─ deploy.zsh ──→  ~/.cline/rules/clinerules-global.md
                                    │                │
                              Cline reads it    @-import in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
                              (auto, native)    Claude Code reads it
```

Both clients see the same rules. To edit a rule:

1. Edit the file in `~/.cline/rules/` directly (both clients pick it up immediately).
2. Run `./collect.zsh` to pull the change into `src/rules/` for committing.

Or edit in `src/rules/`, commit, then run `./deploy.zsh` to push to `~/.cline/rules/`
and refresh the `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` `@-import` block.

### Switching clients

| Situation | Client to use |
|---|---|
| Claude tokens available | Claude Code (`claude` CLI or IDE extension) |
| Claude tokens exhausted | Cline with an alternative model (e.g. Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI) |

Rules behave identically in both clients because they read from the same files.
The model changes; the behavioral guardrails do not.

## How it works

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/rules/` | Committed source of truth for your global rule files |
| `deploy.zsh` | Copies `src/rules/*.md` → `~/.cline/rules/`; regenerates `@-imports` in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| `collect.zsh` | Copies `~/.cline/rules/*.md` → `src/rules/` for committing |
| `/install-clinerules` skill | Claude Code skill that re-deploys rules on demand |

### Global rules — no per-project setup

`~/.cline/rules/` is Cline's native global rules directory, loaded automatically in every
workspace. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` `@-imports` pointing at those same files give Claude Code
identical coverage. Once you run `./deploy.zsh`, both clients have the rules active
everywhere with no further setup needed.

## Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux
- Claude Code (desktop app, VS Code extension, or CLI)

## Install

```zsh
git clone <repo-url> clinerules
cd clinerules
./deploy.zsh
```

The installer is idempotent — safe to re-run after updates.

### What `deploy.zsh` does

1. Creates `~/.cline/rules/` if it does not exist
2. Copies `src/rules/*.md` to `~/.cline/rules/` (installs new files, updates changed ones)
3. Removes any legacy `##-prefixed` rule files left from a prior naming convention
4. Regenerates the `@-import` block in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to point at `~/.cline/rules/`
5. Registers this repo as a Claude Code plugin marketplace and installs the `clinerules` plugin

### After install

Restart Claude Code to pick up the `/install-clinerules` skill.

## Using the skill

From any Claude Code session:

- `/install-clinerules`
- "deploy clinerules"
- "set up clinerules"
- "sync clinerules"

The skill runs `deploy.zsh` and reports how many rules were installed or updated.

## Keeping rules in sync

`src/rules/` is the committed source of truth for your rule files.

- **`./collect.zsh`** — copies `~/.cline/rules/*.md` → `src/rules/` so you can commit changes.
- **`./deploy.zsh`** — copies `src/rules/*.md` → `~/.cline/rules/` (runs automatically on install; re-run after pulling updates).

Typical workflow after editing a rule:

```zsh
# 1. Edit ~/.cline/rules/some-rule.md directly
./collect.zsh        # pull changes into the repo
# commit and push
# on another machine: git pull && ./deploy.zsh
```

## Uninstall

```zsh
./uninstall.zsh
```

Removes the plugin's rule files from `~/.cline/rules/` and unregisters the plugin.

## Rule naming and load order

Rules use a `plugin-name-` prefix to identify ownership and avoid collisions across plugins.
Files owned by other plugins are excluded from `src/rules/` and listed in `.collectignore`:

| File | Owner |
|---|---|
| `dbguard-destructive-ops.md` | [db-guard](../db-guard) plugin |

When adding a new rule to this plugin, use the `planning-` prefix.

Cline loads all files in `~/.cline/rules/` as a combined context — order does not affect
how rules are applied.
